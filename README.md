# Project Title: Urban Health Explorer: Journeying Through Doctor Appointment Data


### Project Overview

This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of data extracted from an online doctor's appointment website, Lybrate. Using the BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries for web scraping, data on doctors' specializations, experience, fees, and availability across seven major Indian cities were collected and analyzed. The insights derived from this analysis aim to profile top physicians by specialization, experience, and fees, while also investigating city-wise doctor availability, average fees, and peak service hours to enhance urban healthcare access and efficiency.

### Introduction
The goal of this project is to deploy data-driven insights for healthcare optimization by analyzing the profiles of doctors - from Lybrate across nine specializations in seven major Indian cities. The specializations include:

- Dermatologist
- Dentist
- Ayurveda
- General Physician
- Dietician/Nutritionist
- Homeopathy
- Psychologist
- Gynaecologist
- Orthopedist

> The cities analyzed are:

- Hyderabad
- Mumbai
- Delhi
- Pune
- Bangalore
- Kolkata
- Chennai

### Data Collection
The data was collected using web scraping techniques, employing BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries. Separate scripts were written to extract data for each city, which were then combined into a single DataFrame for analysis.

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The collected data underwent several cleaning and preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and ensuring consistency across the dataset.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
The EDA was conducted to extract meaningful insights, focusing on the following areas:

Profiling top physicians by specialization, experience, and fees
Investigating city-wise doctor availability
Analyzing average consultation fees
Identifying peak service hours
### Results and Insights
Key findings from the analysis include:

`Top Physicians`: Profiles of top physicians were identified based on their specialization, experience, and fees.
`City-Wise Availability`: Insights into the availability of doctors across different cities.
`Average Fees`: Analysis of the average consultation fees for each specialization across different cities.
`Peak Service Hours`: Identification of peak service hours for doctors in various specializations.
### Conclusion
The analysis provides valuable insights that can help optimize healthcare services in urban areas by understanding the distribution and availability of healthcare professionals, their fees, and their service hours.

### Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required to run the project:

- BeautifulSoup
